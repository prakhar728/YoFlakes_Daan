# ABOUT THE PROJECT

A Transparent Donation Website that ensures no middlemen takes away what rightly belongs to those in need.

## THE PROBLEM

What we aim to improve on through this app is Education and Poverty. 

Often the news make headlines that a NGO was just out there making money, or laundering it. Some NGO's are a front for something entirely against the very cause of the NGO. 

A regular Donation App does have features but it lacks a lot of them too! Here are a few of them 

*  No middleman
* No extra charges
* No worries


### WE ALSO DECIDED A GOOD USER FLOW AND DESIGN BEFORE MAKING THE APP



Here's the Figma Design File 

 [Figma!](https://www.figma.com/file/dqqeN55uWUssjmTaWbXqmm/Daan?node-id=0%3A1) 

* This website uses Ethereum network because of it's low gas fees and high transaction rate.

* It utilises ipfs to upload and store the nfts

* We used React, Figma, blockchain and IPFS to make this project a success.
