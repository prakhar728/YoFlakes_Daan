# Daan & It's Future

## Brief Overview

---

Daan is a Decentralized Charity and Fundraiser website. It’s aimed to lose the middleman involved in the various NGO schemes and connect the Donators to the people in need directly.
Daan will also feature a DAO feature where the Funds collected won’t be transferred unless the withdrawer specifies why and how they will spend it, and then it will have to be Approved by the donators(who become members by donating).

A website called Bitgive exists. It serves the noble purpose of raising donation camps and donating too. We want to incentivize donation and promote philanthropy through the use of NFTs. With every NFT unique to the donator(Generated through a microservice).

## Objectives

---

1. A better system to raise a campaign, add social profiles if needed, add a goal, a date-time for the end of the campaign or a set amount limit.
2. A DAO system so that the person who started the campaign can ask the donators for a withdraw when needed.
3. A way to update the current donators through email about the current updates to the project.

## Problem it solves

---

1. It removes the painstaking middleman and directly connects donators to the people or the cause to which they are donating.
2. The act of philanthropy is being rewarded in return through NFTs.
3. We don’t make a cut to our organization, all the money donated goes directly into the wallet address though which the campaign was started(after the voting process).

## Implementation

---

- Me and my Teammate Vanshika Goel have participated in two hackathons while building this project. I handled the Coding part and Vanshika handled the design part for the project.
- The project is still in the building phase, even though a prototype has been made it hasn’t been deployed yet(pupeteer) being the issue. It’s a just a very small part of the bigger picture.
- The Dapp is a noble idea aimed at making the world at better place by providing a smooth way to raise and donate to campaigns. The Polygon ecosystem can have a project that enables this. Through Polygon the Campaign starting and donating fee is almost None(in Indian rupees) and this can help bring more and more users to the platform as well as introduce them to polygon.

## Why this project?

---

The project needs to exist in the ecosystem because of the Novelty of it. A Dapp which can help the donators and the people in need. My personal motivation is that I have often seen cases where a NGO running is a front for a business that is opposite to the NGO’s moto, a way where donation camps, and Fundraisers are publicly available, their activities public can really help this space.

I see this project go up and far. Seeing people who ask for donations because their family member was in immediate need of money this platform can be perfect for them and prevent other donation camps to cut away their fee. By revolutionizing the Philanthropy space we, along with Polygon that is, can make this Project **THE DONATION WEBSITE.**
